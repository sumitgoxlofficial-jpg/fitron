# Analytics on fitron.in

Google Analytics 4 is **off until you switch it on**, and even then it only runs for visitors who agree to it.

1. Create a GA4 property and copy its measurement ID (`G-XXXXXXXXXX`).
2. Set `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` on the server (`.env`, see `.env.example`) and restart. Until this is set, no analytics code is
   requested by any page, and the Content-Security-Policy does not allow Google's scripts.
3. A visitor's choice is stored in their browser (`localStorage`, key `fitron-site-consent`):
   *Accept all* and *Essential only* on the cookie banner, or *Manage settings* for Preferences and Analytics separately.
   Nothing is sent to Google, and no Google script is loaded, unless **Analytics** is ticked. Withdrawing consent stops
   events and removes the `_ga` cookies.
4. The tracker is `public/site/analytics.js`. It switches off advertising features and Google signals and anonymises IP
   addresses: it is for measurement only. FITRON uses no advertising cookies.

Before you turn it on, check that the Privacy Policy's cookie section (`/privacy#cookies`) names Google Analytics as the
analytics provider. The policy already says that, with consent, anonymised analytics are collected; if your lawyer wants the
provider named, add it there.

## Events

Add `data-track="event_name"` (and `data-track-from="where on the page"`) to any link or button and the click is sent.
Some links are named automatically (WhatsApp, e-mail, sign-in, sign-up plans, contact topics).

| `gym_accounting_click` | "Explore Gym Accounting" in the hero |
| `partner_click` | "Partner With FITRON" in the hero |
| `partner_lead` | "Become a FITRON Partner", "Talk to Sales", a partner plan, or `/contact?topic=partner` |

| `contact_submit` | The contact form was sent (`topic` = what was chosen) |

### Not in the website yet

These happen inside the apps, behind a sign-in, where the page policy forbids third-party scripts. They need a server-side
call (GA4 Measurement Protocol) or a deliberate change to the console's Content-Security-Policy, which is a security
decision and not made here:

`signup_complete`, `checkout_initiated`, `subscription_started`, `subscription_cancelled`, `purchase`.

## Search Console
